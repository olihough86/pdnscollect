Browser extension and local listener PoC for collecting your own DNS data while browsing

This is not a finsihed working project you can clone and run, if you don't know how to load a dev Chrome extension, if you know nothing about Go or how to post data to an API, this is not for you. It doesn't even store the data, just outputs it to the console and moves on. I've had 1 coffee this morning and protoyped it.

think of a very small number, it's that version.

If you think it's a cool concept though... I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU go mad, create PRs, I'll be on this all day at least until something that works pops out of the other end. Consider Elastic for storage, I like it.
